# Autonomous Drone-Based System for High-Precision Structural Crack Detection


*A state-of-the-art deep learning pipeline for identifying, measuring, and analyzing structural defects on high-rise infrastructure, now enhanced with Gemini AI.*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete codebase for an industrial-grade, deep learning system designed for the autonomous inspection of structural cracks on buildings using drones. The primary objective is to move beyond simple detection and provide a quantitative, actionable analysis of defects, focusing on cracks with a width of **3mm or greater**.

The system is built to be robust, reliable, and data-driven, leveraging a state-of-the-art **U-Net++ architecture with an EfficientNet backbone** to perform precise semantic segmentation. This allows for the accurate measurement of critical crack properties such as **length, width, and orientation**.
