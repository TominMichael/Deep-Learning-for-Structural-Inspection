# Deep-Learning-for-Structural-Inspection
Deep Learning Model for High-Precision Crack Segmentation This repository contains the deep learning model developed for the high-precision detection and analysis of structural cracks. The model is designed to perform semantic segmentation, identifying cracks at a pixel level from high-resolution images.
